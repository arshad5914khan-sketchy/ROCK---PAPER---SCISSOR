Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
INTRODUCTION
This is a simple command-line game where a user plays Rock-Paper-Scissors against the computer. It is a beginner-level Python project designed to understand how computers make random choices and how to handle conditional logic in programming.

ABOUT CODE
The project is built using Python.

Library: I used the random module, specifically the randint function, to let the computer pick a number (1, 2, or 3) representing Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

Logic: The decision-making is done using multiple nested if-statements.

First, the code checks what the player chose.

Inside that check, it compares the player's choice against the computer's random choice to decide the winner.

Input Handling: The program takes raw input from the user (string) and compares it against the generated integer logic.

OUTCOME
When the program runs, it asks the user for input, displays what the computer chose, and prints the result.
